The journey of human knowledge can roughly be likened to the steps of a fox and the turn of a hunter.

The fox steps broadly, exploring widely, casting eyes everywhere—much like Isaiah Berlin's fox, who knows many things but masters none. Driven by curiosity, its vision is expansive but its actions spontaneous, easily drifting into superficiality. In sharp contrast, the hunter fixates intently on one point, sharpening continuously, delving deeply toward specialization. Though seemingly opposite, these paths together mark the trajectory of human intellectual growth.

The so-called "living cognitive ledger" is truly a vehicle for the evolution of knowledge. This ledger is no dead relic but rather traces the agile shifts in understanding, sparks innovative ideas, fosters novel connections, and becomes the fountainhead of creativity.

Yet, if the intellectual journey becomes entirely boundless, lingering aimlessly like the fox, it risks becoming busy idleness, shallow and rootless. Conversely, if one remains as stubbornly focused as the hunter, constrained by narrow specialization, one may lose pathways to broader comprehension, falling into rigidity. Hence, one must move fluidly between these extremes, as Dale Zhou suggests, dancing nimbly between the two to achieve wisdom and progress.

Human existence in the vastness between heaven and earth is fleeting. Although ultimate truths remain elusive, human aspirations do not necessarily seek final destinations. Transitioning from scientific realism to pragmatic instrumentalism may slightly dampen enthusiasm, but focused exploration remains essential to sustaining life's meaning and the sharpness of intellect. Even speculative absurdities such as the simulation hypothesis, suggesting our fate is controlled by unseen forces, cannot extinguish human intellectual resilience.

Despite the immensity of the universe and our humble cognition, the desire for knowledge persists undiminished. Once a new understanding is gained, ignorance cannot be reclaimed, and cognitive shifts are irreversible, like water spilled and unrecoverable. Like gentle rainfall gradually nourishing the heart, though lacking grandiosity, knowledge continuously accumulates. Complete truth remains elusive, always oscillating between clarity and obscurity.

The modesty of human intellect is starkly apparent when viewed against the vastness of the cosmos, quantum uncertainty, and imagined realities. Technological advances, such as artificial intelligence, deepen uncertainties between truth and illusion, intensifying existential anxiety. Yet, humanity, observing all these phenomena, continues its relentless pursuit of truth for its utility in survival and mostly irrational desires despite any awareness of potential futility—this pursuit is a defining feature of humanity, though not its sole essence.

The pursuit of knowledge is not a straight climb upward, but a leisurely stroll through shifting vistas, gradually shaping self‑understanding and self-knowledge. Recording these journeys is an interpretive act that clarifies the present, seeds shared narratives.
