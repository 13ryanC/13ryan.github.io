# Product Requirements Document (PRD): MyAI Notes Blog Platform

## Project Overview

We will create a GitHub Pages-hosted Jekyll blog named 'My ResearchNotes' that looks and feels inspired by DeepMind's public blog while maintaining original branding and styling. The platform will serve as a professional research notes blog with a clean, modern interface optimized for readability and content discovery.

This document outlines the requirements for building the blog platform, focusing on both user experience and technical implementation.

## Original Requirements

Create the full codebase for a GitHub Pages–hosted Jekyll blog named "My ResearchNotes". The site must look and feel inspired by DeepMind's public blog while remaining original in branding and styling.

The repository should follow a specific layout structure including configuration files, layouts, includes, assets, and sample content. The homepage and post page UX should follow specific design requirements with a hero section, category filters, article grid, and pagination. The style guide specifies color palette, typography, and accessibility requirements.
