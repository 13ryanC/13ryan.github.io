In theoretical computer science, a **model of computation** specifies what “doing a computation” even means.  To make that idea precise, every well‑defined model supplies three complementary ingredients:

| Ingredient                                                                                 | Role in the model                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Typical examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Information carrier** (also called the *configuration space* or *state space*)        | The medium in which data and control information live during the computation.  It fixes the alphabet or data types that can be stored and the geometric or logical arrangement of those data items.                         | • Infinite tape of cells in a Turing machine  <br>• Finite set of registers, each holding a natural number, in a register machine  <br>• Expression tree in the λ‑calculus  <br>• Vector of real numbers in an artificial neural network                                                                                                          |
| **2. Allowed elementary transformations** (the *transition function* or *reduction rules*) | The model’s primitive “moves”—atomic actions that change one configuration into another.  They are the building blocks from which every full computation is composed, much the way legal moves define a game of chess.      | • “Read symbol, write symbol, move head ± 1, change state” in a Turing machine  <br>• “Increment / decrement register, jump if zero” instructions in a register machine  <br>• β‑reduction (substitution) steps in the λ‑calculus  <br>• Weighted‑sum followed by activation function in one neuron during a discrete‑time update of a neural net |
| **3. Output‑extraction rule** (the *output function*)                                      | A prescription for interpreting some part of the final (or limiting) configuration as the answer to the posed problem.  Without this, the machine could reach a halting state but we would not know how to read the result. | • The string written between the left‑end marker and the first blank on a Turing tape  <br>• The contents of register 0 when the program halts  <br>• The normal form of a λ‑expression (a term with no further β‑reductions)  <br>• The values on designated output neurons after the network settles                                            |

### Putting the three pieces together

1. **Set‑up.**  Encode the input onto the information carrier in the prescribed way (e.g., write the binary number on the tape).
2. **Computation.**  Repeatedly apply the elementary transformations, each time moving from one legal configuration to the next, until no rule applies (halting) or indefinitely if the model allows infinite time.
3. **Decoding.**  Invoke the output‑extraction rule on the final configuration to obtain an ordinary mathematical object (number, string, Boolean, etc.) that we call the computed value.

Mathematically, one often packages these ingredients as a triple $(C,\; \rightarrow,\; \mathsf{out})$:

* $C$ – set of configurations (information carrier)
* $\rightarrow \subseteq C \times C$ – transition relation generated by the allowed elementary steps
* $\mathsf{out}: C \to \Sigma^\*$ (or to some other range) – partial function that reports the answer for halting configurations

Different choices for the three ingredients lead to different computational models, but—by Church‑Turing‑style equivalence results—many of them turn out to compute exactly the same class of functions, reinforcing the idea that these three components capture the essential skeleton of what it means to compute.
