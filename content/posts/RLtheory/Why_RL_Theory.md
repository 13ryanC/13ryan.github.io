There’s plenty of introductory material and textbooks on RL, yet, to be honest, I still don’t fully grasp any of them.

Even when they show working demos, it often feels like hand-waving—just code that suddenly works.

I can replicate the experiments and vaguely follow the flow, but can I explain clearly *why* things happen instead of simply pointing to some authoritative paper?

I’ve had enough. I’m going to write my own informal notes—analyzed from my perspective.

For context, I’m self-taught in real analysis, axiomatic set theory, and axiomatic geometry.

Hand-waving doesn’t stick; my brain filters it out. I need a solid baseline I can trust.

My years in engineering felt wasted because everything relied on that same leap of faith. After studying rigorous math, it’s hard to accept hand-waving in any domain.

For now, I’m focusing on RL before committing to DL. RL captured my interest back in 2020 when I watched Hado van Hasselt’s UCL lectures.

Only now, four years later, am I getting truly serious about it.

So let’s dive in.
